Known in the family as ‘Mac’ he married Dorothy Osbourn (‘Bobbie’) at St John’s Church, Moor Allerton, Leeds on 2nd July 1942, after enlisting and presumably in anticipation of service abroad. She was 23 and without rank or profession, he was 28 and a pharmacist (though also qualified as an optician). The photograph below records the event, the portrait probably being taken in 1942.\n\r\r\rDuring the Second World War Mac enlisted on 16th April 1942 aged 28 into the Royal Army Medical Corps 50 General Hospital (50 BGH) (Army No. 7405034) as a dispenser/pharmacist. As an optician he would have been ‘reserved’ above the age of 30 at the start of the war but this was revised up to 35 in 1941; as a pharmacist he was in a reserved occupation at any age, so he ‘volunteered’ or perhaps used his optician qualification to circumvent this1. His rank after training at Boyce Barracks, Church Crookham, Hants was Sergeant (for regular soldiers it took ~10 years to reach this rank and nowadays he would be an officer). 50 BGH was stationed at Chepstow from March to November 1942 and in that month went to Algiers by boat from\n  According to Juliette Pattinson, Gender \u0026amp; History, Vol.28 No.3 November 2016, pp. 709–727 a key change which released reserved men into the forces was the replacement in December 1941 of block reservations by occupation with that of individual deferments: a man now had to be doing a vital job in a key establishment in a reserved industry as well as meet the age requirements. Individual deferments could only be granted to men undertaking work of the utmost importance. This combing out of men from essential industries, which was made possible by the mobilisation of women, resulted in a gradual de-reservation by age groups, the disappearance of occupational reservation and the implementation of individual deferment of men according to the importance of their work. With this change from block reservation to individual deferment, the official policy of reservation came to an end and the (Reserved Occupations) Schedule ceased to exist. A system akin to that used in the First World War, with military service tribunals making decisions about recruits, then went into effect. From 1942, reserved men were required periodically to complete a form giving information about the nature of their duties to ensure that individually they were making an adequate contribution to the national war effort. There are reports of men in reserved occupations having their request to volunteer turned down and considerable social pressure on those not serving to make a more substantial contribution to the war effort. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   "});})();
